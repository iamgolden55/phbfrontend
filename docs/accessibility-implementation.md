## Introduction

The PHB platform is committed to ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can access healthcare services effectively. This document provides a comprehensive guide for implementing accessibility features that address the needs of diverse user groups, including those with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive impairments.

### Objective

The primary objectives of the accessibility implementation are to:

1. Remove barriers that prevent users with disabilities from accessing healthcare services
2. Enhance communication between patients with disabilities and healthcare providers
3. Ensure compliance with relevant accessibility standards and regulations
4. Create an inclusive healthcare experience that accommodates diverse needs

### Business Impact

Implementing robust accessibility features will:

- Expand the platform's user base to include 15-20% of the population with disabilities
- Comply with legal requirements for healthcare accessibility
- Improve overall user experience through universal design principles
- Enhance the platform's reputation as an inclusive healthcare solution
- Potentially reduce healthcare disparities for marginalized groups

## Accessibility Standards

The PHB platform aims to meet or exceed the following accessibility standards:

### Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)

- **Target Compliance Level**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA
- **Key Focus Areas**:
  - Perceivable information and user interface
  - Operable user interface and navigation
  - Understandable information and user interface
  - Robust content that can be interpreted by assistive technologies

### Healthcare-Specific Standards

- **Digital Service Standard for Healthcare (NHS Digital)**
- **Section 508 compliance** (for U.S. healthcare systems)
- **EN 301 549** (European accessibility standard)

### Regulatory Requirements

- Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance
- EU Web Accessibility Directive
- Healthcare-specific accessibility regulations in target markets

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a user-centered design approach with the following key strategies:

### 1. Accessibility Central Framework

Develop a core accessibility framework that will:

- Provide standardized components with built-in accessibility features
- Manage user preferences and accessibility settings across the platform
- Integrate with assistive technologies through standard APIs
- Monitor and report on accessibility compliance

### 2. Accessibility Preference System

Implement a comprehensive user preference system allowing users to:

- Select preferred communication methods (text, video, sign language)
- Configure display settings (contrast, text size, animations)
- Set assistive technology preferences
- Store accessibility profiles that persist across sessions

### 3. Multi-Modal Interaction Design

Design all key user flows to support multiple interaction modes:

- Visual interface with accessible design
- Keyboard navigation paths
- Voice command options
- Touch interface with appropriate target sizes
- Support for standard assistive technology inputs

### 4. Inclusive Design Process

- Include users with disabilities in design and testing phases
- Conduct accessibility audits throughout development
- Implement automated and manual testing for accessibility compliance
- Train development team on accessibility requirements and techniques
