## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (which includes npm) or Bun installed.
*   Git

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iamgolden55/phbfrontend.git
    cd phbfrontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *   Using npm:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   Or using Bun:
        ```bash
        bun install
        ```

### Running the Development Server

1.  Start the Vite development server:
    *   Using npm:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    *   Or using Bun:
        ```bash
        bun run dev
        ```
2.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the address provided by Vite, which might be different if the port is occupied). The `--host 0.0.0.0` flag makes it accessible on your local network.

## Available Scripts

*   `dev`: Starts the development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
*   `build`: Compiles the TypeScript code and bundles the application for production using Vite.
*   `lint`: Lints the code in the `src` directory using ESLint and attempts to fix issues.
*   `preview`: Serves the production build locally for testing.
*   `typecheck`: Runs the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors without emitting files.
*   `predeploy`: Runs the `build` script before deployment (used by the `deploy` script).
*   `deploy`: Deploys the production build to Netlify (requires Netlify CLI and authentication).

## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Netlify. The `netlify.toml` file likely contains build settings, and the `deploy` script uses the Netlify CLI. Pushing to the configured branch on GitHub might also trigger automatic deployments if Netlify integration is set up.
