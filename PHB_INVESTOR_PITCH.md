## 🌍 IMPACT (The "Why This Matters" Story)

### Lives We'll Save (The Emotional Hook):

**Real Story**:
> "Amina, a pregnant woman in Kano, visited 4 hospitals in one week. Each hospital repeated the same tests because they couldn't access her records. By the time the 4th hospital diagnosed her eclampsia, it was too late. Her baby didn't survive."

**With PHB**:
> "Amina's records would be instant. The 2nd hospital would've seen the warning signs. AI would've flagged the risk. Her baby would be alive."

### The Numbers:
- **40,000** maternal deaths/year in Nigeria (2nd worst in world)
- **PHB Impact**: Reduce by 20% = 8,000 lives saved
- **200M** Nigerians without digital health records
- **PHB Impact**: 2M digitized in Year 3, 20M in 5 years

### Immigration & Refugee Impact:
- **500,000+** Nigerians apply for visas annually (need medical screening)
- **PHB Impact**: Instant health verification, reduce visa processing from 3 weeks to 3 days
- **50,000+** refugees/asylum seekers in Nigeria
- **PHB Impact**: Free health IDs, AI-powered health assessments in camps

**This isn't just a business - it's national infrastructure. Like BVN transformed banking, HPN will transform healthcare.**

1. **Massive Market**: ₦861M growing at 30%/year, government spending ₦1.2B on health digitization
2. **Proven Model**: Helium Health raised $30M, we're doing 10x more (patients + hospitals + government)
3. **Unfair Advantage**: First HPN system, NDPR-ready, government alignment, team that ships

**Nigerian investors made 50x on Paystack ($200M exit), 30x on Flutterwave ($3B valuation).**

**PHB is the "Paystack of Healthcare" - same playbook, bigger problem, government buyer instead of Stripe.**
