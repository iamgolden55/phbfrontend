            Many women choose to wait until after the first trimester (around 12 weeks) to announce their pregnancy widely, as the risk of miscarriage decreases significantly after this point. However, there\'s no right or wrong time to share your news.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            You might want to tell close family members, friends, or your employer earlier, especially if you\'re experiencing significant symptoms or need support. The decision about when and how to announce your pregnancy is personal.

              Many women find the second trimester (weeks 13-27) more comfortable than the first. During this time, you can generally expect:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>Relief from morning sickness and extreme fatigue for many women</li>

              <li>A visibly growing bump</li>
              <li>More energy and a general feeling of wellbeing</li>
              <li>The exciting 20-week scan where you can see your baby in detail</li>
              <li>Potentially learning your baby\'s sex, if you choose to</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3 text-sm">
              The second trimester is often considered the "honeymoon period" of pregnancy, when many discomforts ease and the risk of complications is lower.
