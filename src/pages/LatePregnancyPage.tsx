                  Your baby continues to gain weight rapidly, and their brain is developing quickly. Their skin becomes less transparent and more opaque as fat accumulates beneath it. Your baby can open and close their eyes and may be able to see light that filters through your womb. By week 32, your baby is about 42-43 cm (16.5 inches) long and weighs around 1.7-1.9 kg (3.7-4.2 pounds).

                  Your baby's lungs are maturing, and they're practicing breathing movements. Their bones are hardening, though the skull remains soft and flexible for birth. Most babies move into a head-down position during this time. By week 36, your baby is about 47-48 cm (18.5-19 inches) long and weighs around 2.5-2.7 kg (5.5-6 pounds).

                  Your baby is considered full term at 37 weeks. They continue to gain weight and develop more fat stores. Their digestive system and lungs are ready to function outside the womb. The baby's movements may change as space becomes tight, but they should remain regular. By week 40, most babies weigh between 3-4 kg (6.6-8.8 pounds) and are 48-52 cm (19-20.5 inches) long.
