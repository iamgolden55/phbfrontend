            The second trimester spans from week 13 to week 27 of pregnancy and is often referred to as the "honeymoon period." Most women find that many early pregnancy discomforts ease during this time, and energy levels improve.

                  Your baby\'s facial features are becoming more defined, and unique fingerprints develop. Your baby can make facial expressions and may begin to suck their thumb. By week 16, your baby is about 11-12 cm (4.5 inches) long.

                  Fine hair called lanugo covers your baby\'s body, and a protective coating called vernix caseosa forms on the skin. Your baby\'s movements become stronger and more coordinated, and you\'ll likely begin to feel them. By week 20, your baby is about 16-18 cm (6.5-7 inches) long.

                  Your baby\'s sense of touch and hearing develop. They can hear your voice and may respond to loud sounds. Your baby establishes sleep and wake cycles, and their movements become more regular. By the end of this trimester, your baby weighs around 900g (2 pounds) and is about 35 cm (14 inches) long.

            One of the most exciting developments during the second trimester is feeling your baby move for the first time, known as "quickening." Most first-time mothers feel movements between 18-20 weeks, while women who have been pregnant before may notice them earlier, around 16 weeks.

              <li>Early movements often feel like flutters, bubbles, or a light tapping sensation</li>
              <li>As your baby grows, movements become stronger and more distinct</li>
              <li>By 24 weeks, you should feel regular movements every day</li>
              <li>Your baby will develop patterns of activity and rest</li>
              <li>Movements are a good sign of your baby\'s wellbeing</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3 text-sm">
              <strong>Note:</strong> If you notice a significant decrease in your baby\'s movements after 24 weeks, contact your healthcare provider right away. Regular movement is an important sign of fetal wellbeing.

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Checking your blood pressure</li>

          <p className="mb-3">
            A major part of second-trimester care is the detailed anomaly scan, usually performed between 18 and 22 weeks.

          <div className="bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg p-5 mb-6">
            <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">During the anomaly scan, the sonographer will:</h4>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>Check your baby\'s size and growth</li>
              <li>Examine your baby\'s major organs (brain, heart, lungs, kidneys, etc.)</li>
              <li>Look at the placenta, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid</li>
              <li>Check the position of the placenta</li>

              This scan can detect about 50% of structural abnormalities. While it can be reassuring when everything looks normal, it\'s important to understand that not all conditions can be detected by ultrasound.

            <li><strong>Glucose screening test</strong> (24-28 weeks) – to check for gestational diabetes</li>

            <li><strong>Amniocentesis</strong> – if earlier screening suggested increased risk for chromosomal conditions</li>
