          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Overview</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people go through periods of feeling down, but when you're depressed, you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Some people think depression is trivial or not a genuine health condition. They're wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms. Depression is not a sign of weakness or something you can "snap out of" by "pulling yourself together".
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding depression in African communities</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In many African communities, mental health conditions like depression may be understood differently than in Western contexts. Various local terms exist to describe what might be recognized as depression in clinical settings.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Depression may sometimes be attributed to spiritual causes, social problems, or family issues. It's important to understand that depression is a medical condition that can affect anyone, regardless of their background or circumstances.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Seeking help for depression is not a sign of weakness but an important step toward healing. Treatment can incorporate both modern healthcare approaches and traditional support systems that are meaningful to you.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Overcoming stigma</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In many communities, there can be stigma attached to mental health problems such as depression. This stigma can make people reluctant to seek help.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Remember that depression is a medical condition, not a personal failure. Seeking help for depression is a sign of strength, not weakness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Community leaders, healthcare workers, and educators play an important role in raising awareness about depression and reducing stigma. If you feel comfortable, sharing your experiences may help others understand that they are not alone.
