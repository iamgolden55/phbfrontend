          <p className="mb-4">
            Stress is the body's reaction to feeling threatened or under pressure. It's very common, can be motivating to help us achieve things in our daily life, and can help us meet the demands of home, work and family life.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            But too much stress can affect our mood, our body and our relationships â€“ especially when it feels out of our control. It can make us feel anxious and irritable, and affect our self-esteem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period of time can also lead to a feeling of physical, mental and emotional exhaustion, often called burnout.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Causes of stress</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            All sorts of situations can cause stress. The most common involve work, money matters and relationships with partners, children or other family members.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Stress may be caused by major life events such as:

            <li>Moving home</li>

            <li>Divorce or relationship breakdown</li>
          </ul>

          <p>But stress can also be caused by a series of small, seemingly insignificant things that mount up over time, such as feeling undervalued at work or arguing with a family member.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">10 tips to help with stress</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4 space-y-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Split up big tasks</strong>
              <p>If a task seems overwhelming and difficult to start, try breaking it down into easier chunks, and give yourself credit for completing them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Allow yourself some positivity</strong>
              <p>Take time to think about the good things in your life. Each day, consider what went well and try to list 3 things you're thankful for.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Challenge unhelpful thoughts</strong>
              <p>The way we think affects the way we feel. Watch out for thoughts like "I can't do this" or "Everything is going wrong". Try to replace them with balanced thoughts like "I can do this if I break it down" or "Some things are difficult right now, but not everything is bad".</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Be more active</strong>
              <p>Being active can help you burn off nervous energy. It will not make your stress disappear, but it can make it less intense.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Talk to someone</strong>
              <p>Talking to someone you trust about what's making you stressed can help. You can try a friend or family member.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Plan your time</strong>
              <p>Planning out your day or week can help you feel more in control of things.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Create a wellness toolkit</strong>
              <p>Come up with a list of activities that help you relax, such as having a bath, reading a book, or going for a walk.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Practice mindfulness</strong>
              <p>Mindfulness can help you focus on the present moment rather than worrying about the past or future.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Get a good night's sleep</strong>
              <p>Good quality sleep makes a big difference to how we feel, so it's important to get enough.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Limit caffeine and alcohol</strong>
              <p>Drinking too much caffeine or alcohol can increase feelings of anxiety. Try to cut down or avoid them completely if you can.</p>
