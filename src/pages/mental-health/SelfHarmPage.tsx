          <p className="mb-4">
            Self-harm is when someone intentionally damages or injures their body. It's usually a way of coping with or expressing overwhelming emotional distress.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Sometimes, people harm themselves because they want to punish themselves, or they may self-harm to signal to others that they need support. Self-harm can also be a cry for help.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're self-harming, you should speak to someone you trust or seek professional help. Remember, you're not alone and help is available.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="mb-8">
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Self-harm in African communities</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In many African communities, self-harm and mental health challenges may be viewed through different cultural, spiritual, or social perspectives. These views can sometimes make it difficult for individuals to seek help.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            It's important to understand that self-harm is often a response to emotional pain and is not typically related to witchcraft, spiritual possession, or moral failure – views that can sometimes exist in communities.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Self-harm affects people from all backgrounds, regardless of age, gender, or social status. Understanding self-harm as a health issue is crucial for providing appropriate support and reducing stigma.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why people self-harm</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Self-harm is more common than many people realize, especially among younger people.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The reasons why people self-harm are complex and vary from person to person. Some people have described self-harm as a way to:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Express feelings that can't be put into words</li>
            <li>Deal with feelings of shame or guilt</li>
            <li>Turn emotional pain into physical pain</li>
            <li>Regain control over their feelings</li>
            <li>Distract themselves from emotional pain</li>
            <li>Communicate to others that they're distressed</li>
            <li>Punish themselves for perceived 'wrongdoings'</li>
          </ul>

          <p className="mb-4">
            Self-harm often has an addictive quality, making it difficult to stop. For some people, it may be a one-off incident, but for others it can become a long-term coping mechanism.

          <p className="mb-4">
            If you discover someone you care about is self-harming, your reaction can make a big difference to their recovery. Here's how you can help:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>Stay calm and don't judge</li>
            <li>Let them know you're there for them</li>
            <li>Encourage them to speak to a healthcare provider or community health worker</li>
            <li>Offer to go with them to appointments</li>
            <li>Help them identify triggers and find alternative coping strategies</li>
            <li>Learn about self-harm to better understand what they're going through</li>
            <li>Respect their confidentiality while ensuring they get appropriate help</li>
            <li>Be patient – recovery takes time</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            It's important to take care of your own mental health too. Supporting someone who self-harms can be challenging, so make sure you have someone to talk to as well.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Overcoming stigma</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In many communities, there can be significant stigma surrounding self-harm and mental health issues. People may be reluctant to seek help due to fear of judgment or misunderstanding.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            It's important to understand that self-harm is a health issue, not a character flaw or a spiritual failing. Changing attitudes begins with education and open, compassionate conversations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Healthcare providers, community leaders, teachers, and religious figures all have important roles to play in reducing stigma and creating environments where people feel safe seeking help.
