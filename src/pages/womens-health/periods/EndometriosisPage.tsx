              <p className="mb-4">
                Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the womb (endometrium) grows outside the uterus, commonly on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and tissues lining the pelvis. In rare cases, it can grow beyond the pelvic region.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                This tissue acts like normal endometrial tissue â€” it thickens, breaks down, and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. However, because it has no way to exit the body, it becomes trapped. When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form. Surrounding tissue can become irritated, eventually developing scar tissue and adhesions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Endometriosis can cause pain, sometimes severe, especially during menstrual periods. It can also lead to fertility problems. Fortunately, effective treatments are available.
