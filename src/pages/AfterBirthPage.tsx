                The concept of the fourth trimester recognizes that newborns are still developing and adapting to life outside the womb during their first three months, while mothers are undergoing significant physical and emotional transitions. This period requires special care, support, and adjustment for both you and your baby.

                During this time, your baby is learning to regulate their bodily functions, developing their senses, and adjusting to the external environment. Meanwhile, your body is recovering from pregnancy and childbirth, and you're adapting to new routines, sleep patterns, and parenting responsibilities.

          <h3 className="font-medium text-lg mb-3">Creating routines</h3>
          <p className="mb-3">
            In the early weeks, your baby's needs will drive your schedule. Gradually, you'll develop patterns that work for your family.
