            {
              question: "How do I know if I'm entitled to benefits?",
              answer: "The best way to find out is to have a benefits check with an advisor. They'll look at your circumstances and health conditions to see what you might be entitled to. Many people are surprised to discover they qualify for support they didn't know existed."
            },
            {
              question: "Will applying for benefits affect other support I receive?",
              answer: "Sometimes benefits can affect each other, but often in positive ways - receiving one benefit can increase your entitlement to others. An advisor can help you understand how different benefits work together and ensure you get your maximum entitlement."
            },
            {
              question: "What if my application is refused?",
              answer: "Many initial applications are refused, but this doesn't mean you're not entitled. You have the right to ask for the decision to be reconsidered and to appeal if necessary. Advisors can help you through this process, and many appeals are successful."
            },
            {
              question: "How long does it take to get benefits?",
              answer: "It varies by benefit type, but most decisions are made within a few weeks to a few months. Some benefits can provide emergency payments while you wait. If you're in immediate need, let your advisor know as there may be quicker forms of support available."
            },
            {
              question: "Will I have to pay benefits back if my situation improves?",
              answer: "Generally, no. Most benefits are designed to change with your circumstances - if you get better, payments may reduce or stop, but you usually don't have to repay what you've already received. The important thing is to report changes when they happen."
