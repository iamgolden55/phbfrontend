              question: "Will the person I care for know about my assessment?",
              answer: "Your carer assessment is confidential, but we encourage open communication when possible. You can choose whether to tell the person you care for about your assessment. Sometimes involving them can help them understand your needs better."
            },
            {
              question: "What if I feel guilty about asking for help for myself?",
              answer: "Feeling guilty is very common among carers, but remember that taking care of yourself helps you provide better care. You deserve support, and getting help isn't selfish - it's responsible. Many carers find that support actually improves their caring relationship."
            },
            {
              question: "Will I have to pay for services after my assessment?",
              answer: "Whether you pay for services depends on your financial situation and the type of support. Many carer services are free, and we'll clearly explain any costs. Financial assessments are separate and optional - you won't be forced to pay more than you can afford."
            },
            {
              question: "How long does a carer assessment take?",
              answer: "A typical carer assessment takes 45-90 minutes, but we can take as long as you need. We can also split it across multiple sessions if that works better for you. The important thing is that you have time to discuss everything that matters to you."
            },
            {
              question: "What if my caring situation changes after the assessment?",
              answer: "You can request a review of your assessment anytime your situation changes. This might be due to changes in your health, the health of the person you care for, your work situation, or any other significant life changes."

              Caring for someone else is one of the most selfless things you can do, but you shouldn't 
              have to sacrifice your own wellbeing to do it. A carer assessment is your opportunity to 
              get the support you need to continue caring while living your own life too.
