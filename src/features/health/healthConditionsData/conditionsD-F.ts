        question: 'How contagious is Ebola?',

It spreads through direct contact with body fluids (blood, vomit, feces, urine, saliva, sweat, semen) of infected people who are showing symptoms, not through casual contact or airborne transmission. However, when transmission occurs, the virus is highly virulent with a high fatality rate.'

        question: 'Can Ebola survivors infect others after recovery?',
        answer: 'Ebola survivors generally develop immunity to the strain that infected them, but the virus can persist in certain body fluids (particularly semen) for months after recovery. The virus has been found in semen up to 18 months after recovery in some cases, creating a risk of sexual transmission. Survivors are advised to practice safe sex or abstinence for at least 12 months after recovery or until their semen tests negative twice.'

        question: 'Can dengue fever be transmitted from person to person?',

        question: 'Why is a second dengue infection more dangerous than the first?',
        answer: 'Second infections with a different dengue serotype can be more severe due to a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Antibodies from the first infection can actually help the second virus infect more cells, potentially leading to severe dengue. This is why having prior exposure to dengue is a risk factor for developing severe disease with subsequent infections.'

However, symptoms may fluctuate over time, with periods of flare-ups and remissions. Proper management can help reduce symptom severity.'

      {
        question: 'How is fibromyalgia diagnosed?',
