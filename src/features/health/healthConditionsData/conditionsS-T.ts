        question: 'Is schizophrenia the same as having multiple personalities?',
        answer: 'No, schizophrenia is not the same as having multiple personalities (now known as Dissociative Identity Disorder). This is one of the most common misconceptions about schizophrenia. The confusion may stem from the word\'s etymology - "schizo" (split) and "phrenia" (mind) - which might suggest a "split personality." However, this refers to the split from reality that people with schizophrenia experience, not a splitting of personality. Schizophrenia is characterized by psychotic symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, disorganized thinking, and negative symptoms (reduced emotional expression, lack of motivation). In contrast, Dissociative Identity Disorder involves the presence of two or more distinct personality states or experiences of possession. These are entirely different mental health conditions with different causes, symptoms, and treatments. People with schizophrenia typically maintain a single identity but experience a distorted perception of reality, rather than shifting between different identities.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can people with schizophrenia live normal lives?',
        answer: 'Yes, many people with schizophrenia can lead fulfilling, meaningful lives, especially with appropriate treatment and support. While schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that presents significant challenges, it\'s important to understand that outcomes vary greatly among individuals. With a combination of medication, psychosocial interventions, and support services, many people with schizophrenia can manage their symptoms effectively. Key factors that influence outcomes include: 1) Early intervention - detecting and treating symptoms early often leads to better outcomes; 2) Consistent treatment - following prescribed medication regimens and participating in therapy; 3) Strong support networks - family support, peer groups, and community services; 4) Access to comprehensive care - including physical health care, housing assistance, and vocational rehabilitation. Many people with schizophrenia are able to work, have relationships, live independently, and pursue their interests and goals. Public figures like Nobel Prize winner John Nash (portrayed in "A Beautiful Mind") have demonstrated that extraordinary achievement is possible despite a schizophrenia diagnosis. It\'s essential to combat stigma and have realistic hope, recognizing that recovery is a personal journey that may involve both challenges and significant achievements.'
      },
      {
        question: 'At what age does schizophrenia typically develop?',
        answer: 'Schizophrenia typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood, with the peak age of onset between 18 and 25 years for men and 25 and 35 years for women. However, the development of schizophrenia follows different patterns: 1) Late adolescence/early adulthood onset - This is the most common pattern, particularly in males. The transition to adulthood appears to be a vulnerable period, possibly due to the significant brain development and social changes occurring during this time. 2) Later adult onset - Women tend to develop schizophrenia later than men, with many cases appearing in the late 20s to early 30s. Some research suggests that estrogen may have a protective effect until menopause. 3) Early-onset schizophrenia - While less common, schizophrenia can develop before age 18, with childhood-onset (before age 13) being particularly rare and often more severe. 4) Late-onset schizophrenia - Cases that develop after age 40 are considered late-onset and may have slightly different symptom profiles. Before full psychotic symptoms appear, many individuals experience a prodromal phase lasting months or years, characterized by subtle cognitive changes, social withdrawal, and declining functioning. This phase represents an important opportunity for early intervention. Early warning signs may include unusual thinking, mild hallucinations, social withdrawal, declining performance in school or work, and changes in self-care or personality.'

    prevalence: 'Schizophrenia affects approximately 20 million people worldwide, or about 0.5-1% of the global population. The prevalence is relatively consistent across different countries and cultural groups, although presentation and outcomes may vary. Schizophrenia is more common in urban areas and among migrant populations. The lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia is about 0.7%. The condition affects men and women in roughly equal numbers, though men typically develop symptoms earlier than women. Schizophrenia accounts for a significant proportion of global disability, with affected individuals having a life expectancy 10-20 years shorter than the general population, primarily due to co-occurring physical health conditions and higher suicide rates.',

        question: 'What is the difference between a stroke and a heart attack?',
        answer: 'While both are medical emergencies involving interrupted blood flow, they affect different organs. A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked or a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, causing brain cells to die from lack of oxygen. It primarily affects brain function, with symptoms like sudden numbness/weakness (especially on one side), confusion, trouble speaking, vision problems, dizziness, and severe headache. A heart attack (myocardial infarction) happens when blood flow to a part of the heart muscle is blocked, causing heart tissue damage. Heart attack symptoms typically include chest pain/pressure, pain radiating to the arm/jaw/back, shortness of breath, cold sweat, nausea, and fatigue. Both require immediate emergency treatment, but the medications and procedures used differ significantly. The acronym FAST (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties, Time to call emergency services) helps identify stroke symptoms, while heart attack recognition focuses on chest discomfort and associated symptoms.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can someone fully recover from a stroke?',
        answer: 'Recovery from stroke varies greatly depending on several factors, including the type, severity, and location of the stroke, how quickly treatment was received, the person\'s age and overall health, and the intensity of rehabilitation efforts. Some people make a complete or near-complete recovery, particularly after mild strokes or TIAs (transient ischemic attacks). Others experience lasting disabilities ranging from minor to severe. The brain has some ability to reorganize itself (neuroplasticity), allowing healthy areas to take over functions from damaged regions. Most recovery occurs in the first 3-6 months after a stroke, but improvements can continue for years with ongoing therapy and effort. Comprehensive rehabilitation programs, including physical, occupational, and speech therapy, significantly improve outcomes. Early treatment is crucial—the faster a person receives care after stroke symptoms begin, the better their chances for meaningful recovery, highlighting the importance of recognizing stroke symptoms and seeking immediate emergency care.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What are the warning signs before a stroke?',
        answer: 'While strokes often occur suddenly without clear advance warning, some people experience transient ischemic attacks (TIAs or "mini-strokes") beforehand. TIAs produce stroke-like symptoms that typically last minutes to hours but resolve completely within 24 hours. These should be treated as medical emergencies and major warning signs of an impending full stroke—about 1 in 3 people who have a TIA will eventually have a stroke. The symptoms of a TIA are identical to those of a stroke and include sudden onset of: facial drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulties, numbness or weakness (especially on one side of the body), confusion, trouble speaking or understanding, vision problems in one or both eyes, dizziness or loss of balance, and severe headache without known cause. Other potential warning signs in the days or weeks before a stroke may include frequent headaches, changes in mental status or cognition, unexplained dizziness or unsteadiness, or brief episodes of numbness or weakness. Anyone experiencing these symptoms should seek immediate medical attention, even if they resolve quickly.'

      {
        question: 'How does thyroid function affect weight?',
        answer: 'The thyroid produces hormones that regulate metabolism—how your body uses energy. With hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), metabolism slows, often leading to weight gain, difficulty losing weight, and fatigue even with reduced calorie intake. Conversely, hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) speeds up metabolism, typically causing weight loss despite increased appetite. However, weight changes are rarely the only symptom of thyroid disorders, and modest weight gain alone is not usually caused by hypothyroidism. While treating thyroid dysfunction can help normalize metabolism, it may not result in significant weight loss for many people with hypothyroidism.'

Hyperthyroidism carries risks of miscarriage, premature birth, and maternal heart problems. Women with pre-existing thyroid conditions often need dose adjustments during pregnancy.

        answer: 'A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is often called a "mini-stroke" because it produces stroke-like symptoms but no lasting damage. TIA symptoms typically last only a few minutes to hours and then completely resolve. However, TIAs are serious warning signs that a full stroke may occur soon—about one-third of people who have a TIA will have a stroke within a year if untreated. Both TIAs and strokes require immediate medical attention and have the same underlying causes.'

      {
        question: 'Can you recover from a stroke?',
        answer: 'Recovery from stroke varies greatly depending on the location and extent of brain damage, how quickly treatment was received, age, and overall health. Many stroke survivors do recover significantly, especially with prompt treatment and comprehensive rehabilitation. The brain has remarkable ability to form new connections (neuroplasticity), allowing other areas to take over some functions of damaged areas. Recovery is often greatest in the first few months but can continue for years with proper therapy and support.'

        question: 'How can I recognize if someone is having a stroke?',

Additional signs include sudden severe headache, sudden trouble seeing, or sudden trouble walking. Remember: time is brain - every minute counts in stroke treatment.'

        question: 'What is the difference between latent TB and active TB?',

However, the bacteria can become active later if your immune system weakens. Active TB disease means the bacteria are multiplying and causing symptoms. You feel sick and can spread TB to others. About 5-10% of people with latent TB will develop active TB if not treated.'

      {
        question: 'Is tuberculosis contagious?',
        answer: 'Only people with active TB disease in their lungs or throat can spread TB bacteria to others through the air when they cough, speak, sneeze, or sing. People with latent TB infection cannot spread TB. TB is not spread by shaking hands, sharing food or drinks, touching bed linens or toilet seats, or kissing. You\'re most likely to catch TB from someone you live or work with rather than from a stranger.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How long does TB treatment take?',
        answer: 'Treatment for active TB typically takes 6-9 months and involves taking multiple antibiotics daily. It\'s crucial to take all medications exactly as prescribed, even when you start feeling better. Stopping treatment early or missing doses can lead to drug-resistant TB, which is much harder to treat. Treatment for latent TB infection is shorter, typically 3-9 months depending on the medication regimen. Your doctor will monitor your progress with regular check-ups and tests.'
