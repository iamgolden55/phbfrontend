        question: 'Is Parkinson\'s disease fatal?',
        answer: 'Parkinson\'s disease itself is not typically considered fatal, but complications from the disease can reduce life expectancy. Most people with Parkinson\'s have a normal or near-normal life expectancy. However, advanced Parkinson\'s increases the risk of serious complications such as falls, pneumonia, and choking, which can be life-threatening. With proper treatment and management, many people with Parkinson\'s live long, productive lives.'

      {
        question: 'Does everyone with Parkinson\'s disease develop tremors?',
        answer: 'No, not everyone with Parkinson\'s disease develops tremors. While tremor is one of the most recognizable symptoms, about 20% of people with Parkinson\'s never develop tremor. This form is sometimes called "akinetic-rigid" Parkinson\'s, where stiffness and slowness of movement are the predominant symptoms. Each person\'s experience with Parkinson\'s is unique, with different combinations and severity of symptoms.'

        question: 'Can young people get Parkinson\'s disease?',
        answer: 'Yes, although it\'s less common, young people can develop Parkinson\'s disease. When symptoms begin before age 50, it\'s called Young-Onset Parkinson\'s Disease (YOPD). About 2-10% of people with Parkinson\'s are diagnosed before age 50. YOPD is more likely to be associated with genetic factors and may progress more slowly. However, the earlier onset means living with the condition for more years, presenting unique challenges for career, family planning, and long-term care.'

Generally, younger, healthier adults may feel better within a week or two. However, full recovery, including fatigue resolution and return of normal strength, often takes 4-6 weeks. For older adults or those with severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization, recovery may take several months. Even after feeling better, the immune system may still be recovering.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How is pneumonia diagnosed?',
        answer: 'Pneumonia diagnosis typically begins with a physical exam, where the doctor listens to the lungs with a stethoscope for abnormal breathing sounds. Chest X-rays are usually used to confirm the diagnosis and show the extent and location of the infection. Additional tests may include blood tests to check for infection, pulse oximetry to measure oxygen levels, sputum tests to identify the specific germ causing the infection, and sometimes CT scans for more detailed imaging.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can pneumonia spread from person to person?',
        answer: 'Some types of pneumonia are contagious and can spread from person to person, particularly those caused by infectious bacteria or viruses such as influenza, COVID-19, or tuberculosis. These pathogens can spread through airborne droplets from coughs or sneezes, or by touching surfaces contaminated with these germs. However, pneumonia itself isn\'t contagiousâ€”only the germs that cause it. Fungal pneumonia and aspiration pneumonia are not typically contagious.'

    commonQuestions: [
      {
        question: 'How long after a bite does rabies take to develop?',
        answer: 'The incubation period for rabies is typically 1-3 months but can range from less than a week to more than a year. This variability depends on factors like the bite location (closer to the brain means shorter incubation), the severity of the wound, the amount of virus introduced, and the individual\'s immune status. The virus travels from the wound site to the central nervous system via nerve pathways, which explains why bites on the face or neck tend to progress faster than those on extremities. This incubation period allows time for effective post-exposure prophylaxis before symptoms develop.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is rabies 100% fatal once symptoms appear?',
        answer: 'Rabies is almost always fatal once clinical symptoms appear, with a mortality rate approaching 100%. However, there have been a few documented cases of survival, most notably through the experimental Milwaukee Protocol, which involves induced coma and antiviral treatment. Of the approximately 30 people who have received this treatment, only a handful have survived, often with significant neurological deficits. These rare survivals don\'t change the essential fact that rabies should be considered virtually 100% fatal, emphasizing the critical importance of prompt post-exposure prophylaxis after potential exposure.'

        question: 'What\'s the difference between rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis?',
        answer: 'Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) have different causes and symptoms. RA is an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks joint linings, causing inflammation and eventually damaging bone and cartilage. OA results from mechanical wear and tear on joints over time. RA typically affects joints symmetrically (same joints on both sides of body), while OA often affects weight-bearing joints or previously injured joints. RA includes systemic symptoms like fatigue and fever, which are not typical in OA.'

        question: 'Can rheumatoid arthritis go into remission?',
        answer: 'Yes, rheumatoid arthritis can go into remission, especially with early and aggressive treatment. Remission means disease activity is minimal or absent with no signs of active inflammation. There are different types of remission: clinical remission (no observable symptoms), imaging remission (no signs of inflammation on scans), and drug-free remission (maintained without medications). With current treatment approaches, particularly early intervention with disease-modifying drugs, remission is an achievable goal for many patients, though some may still require ongoing treatment to maintain it.'

Some patients report improvement when avoiding potential trigger foods like dairy, gluten, or nightshades, though evidence varies. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil have anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce joint pain. Maintaining a healthy weight reduces stress on joints.
